# JavaUno
CMSC150 Final Project - Uno

This project plays a two-player game of simplified Uno against an AI. This game uses only 0-9 cards of red, yellow, green, and blue, as well as wilds. It plays from 7 cards in each hand until either the player or computer reach 0 cards, and has a functional uno call system.

This project utilizes java.util.Scanner and java.util.Random as extra packages to import.

I utilized methods intrinsic to the base Java software, the Scanner class, and the Random class, but I wrote all the other classes and methods myself.

To play this game, ensure to have Java downloaded. Then, download all the files from this repository, and run the Game.java file.
